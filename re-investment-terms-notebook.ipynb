    "As explained, the cap rate is nice as a quick snapshot to evaluate the property's potential. In the real world, in many cases we would be using leverage (a loan or a mortgage) in order to buy a property for investment.

It is clear that the cap rate is no longer useful - we are not going to pay the full `$2,000,000`, but only `$700,000`, and we are obviously not going to get `$150,000` a year anymore because we have a loan to pay for. \n",

This gives us an \"Annual Debt Service\" (mortage, principal and interest) - of `$88,575` ([here's why](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_calculator)). \n",
    "\n",
    "How does our real return look like? Is it similar to the cap rate? Previously we had a cap rate of `7.5%`, based on a down payment of `$2,000,000` and an NOI of `$150,000` (150,000 / 2,000,000). But now we have a `$700,000` down payment (instead of the `$2,000,000`, the sales price from before), and our NOI is down to 61,425, because we have to pay `$88,575` out of the `$150,000` income for the loan.

The main idea is that a dollar earned today is more valuable than a dollar earned in a future time (because, for examlpe, if you had the money today, you could have invested it and capitalize), therefore, when considering future income, if we want to determine how much it's worth at present, we want to apply a certain discount to it to reflect this potential loss. \n",

Over the course of three years, the project is expected to generate revenues of `$2,000`, `$7,000` and `$11,000`, respectively. The anticipated discount rate is `4.5%`. At first glance, it seems the returns are nearly double the investment. However, a dollar earned in three years is not as valuable as a dollar earned today, so the company's accountant calculates the NPV as follows to determine profitability while accounting for the discounted time value of the projected revenues."
